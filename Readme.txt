About the application:

This application is done by Destruction Team. It is to show that the application is done in respect to the 
air pollution in Macedonia. There are three tabs: Home, Impact and Risk. The home tab that displays the real life data in the tables.
When you click on a picture on the home page, in the tables only the data for that specific city will be shown.
The Impact tab lets you enter your car information and it will calculate how much impact you have on the pollution.
This is done to raise awareness of the overusage of cars and encourage people to take public transport or to use more
eco-friendly terms of transport such as bikes, feet, etc.
Finally, on the third tab, you can find the risks that are present in everyday life if you are living in a polluted
environment. There are also links to sources where you can read more about the pollution and the negative effects it
causes.
On the bottom of the page there are links and references to the sites and APIs used to build this site.

We hope you enjoy our product.

Sincerely,
Destruction Team
